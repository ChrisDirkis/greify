## Greify

Greify is a home-made static site generator, built specifically for [](https://chrisdirk.is). 

### Why?

I've read a few posts here and there to the tune of "jekyll and hugo are too complicated and slow", and thought that building a ssg for my limited use case would be a) fun and b) pretty useful. I'd get a static site instead of the unnecessarily-React site I had previously, and I'd also be able to add whatever feature I wanted. 

This kinda implies that no one else should use this generator, which is more or less correct? but hey, maybe the metaphors I used are good enough for your use case too. 

### How to use

- Install the deps from `requirements.txt` (prefer a venv, if possible)
- Load up the data in the /site folder
- Run!
